Setting Up OpenEBS -  Overview
==============================

OpenEBS can run on various platforms: from your laptop, to VMs on a cloud provider. OpenEBS is also aimed at providing the option of using hybrid deployments where data is distributed between cloud and on-premise environments.

If you are beginner to Kubernetes and OpenEBS, OpenEBS recommends you to get started with either of the following:
  
* running an OpenEBS cluster on your laptop using Vagrant OR 
* if you have access to the Cloud, you can use our custom solutions for Google and Amazon Cloud providers. 

The Kubernetes documentation provides you various Kubernetes installation options to choose from. See `Setup. <https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/>`_

If you are already an experienced Kubernetes user, you can easily setup OpenEBS on your existing Kubernetes cluster with a few simple kubectl commands. See, :ref:`quick-start`.

We are looking for help from the community in including additional platforms where OpenEBS has been successfully deployed. Please share your story through GitHub `Issues <https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues>`_ or `Pull requests <https://github.com/openebs/openebs/pulls>`_.
